    Makefile           A Makefile for compiling, style checking, testing, and
                       cleaning up files in this directory.

    Main.java          Entry point to program. This handles program options
                       and sets up the necessary objects to play one or more
                       games.

    AI.java            This class describes AI player.

    Board.java         Describes a board.

    Move.java          Describe a single move.

    Game.java          Contains the logic for controlling a game: responding
                       to commands by updating the model as apppropriate.

    InputSource.java   An interface to get input to the game, which consists of
                       keystrokes and random tile positions.  It has two
                       implementing subtypes: GUISource and TestSource.

    GUISource.java     An InputSource that fetches inputs from a user's
                       key presses and generates tiles using a
                       pseudo-random number generator (PRNG).

    GUI.java           Represents the graphical display of the game state and
                       receives key presses from the user.  The GUI
                       "observes" the model and responds to changes in it.

    BoardWidget.java   Used by GUI to represent the grid of squares and tiles.

    BoardLogger.java   Another observer of the game state that prints the
                       states of the board to a file, thus allowing one to
                       capture and check the board positions generated by
                       the program.

testing/                 Directory with integration test machinery.

    tester.py          A Python 3 script for testing your program.  It makes
                       use of the --testing option in your program to feed
                       in known moves.
    testing.py         A module that supports testing in general.
    *.in               Test scripts accepted by the tester.
    *.out              The outputs (logged by BoardLogger) expected for each
                       test.
